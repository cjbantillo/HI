# README: Setting Up Supabase Task Application with Docker

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
1. **Apache 2.4** and **PHP 8.1**
2. **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Build and Run the Containers
If you haven't made any changes to the configuration files, run the following command to build and start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
This command will build the Docker images and start the containers in detached mode.  
you can check the status of the containers using:
```bash 
docker-compose ps
```


### 2. Accessing the Application  
access lcalhost:8080 in your browser to see the Nginx welcome page.
This indicates that the Nginx server is running correctly.
You can also access the PHP application by navigating to `localhost:8080` in your web browser. 
This should display the PHP info page, confirming that the PHP-FPM container is working correctly.

as for the supabase SQL table if you want to make your own paste this in SQL editor:
reminder this is just a sample table for the task application, you can modify it as per your requirements.
and your key and url for the supabase project should be in the .env file.
but for mine is just for activity i leave it as it is since im deleting it after this.

```sql  

create table public.tasks (
  "taskId" serial not null,
  task character varying(255) null,
  completed character varying(255) null,
  updated_at timestamp without time zone null default now(),
  constraint tasks_pkey primary key ("taskId")
) TABLESPACE pg_default;


--include this
CREATE POLICY "Allow anon read access" ON tasks
FOR SELECT
USING (true);


```
